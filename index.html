          An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is
          typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with
          danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing,
          scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports.<br /><br />
          Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in
          order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that
          can only be obtained by such activities.

        <p class="text">
          Cycling, also, when on a two-wheeled bicycle, called bicycling[2] or
          biking, is the use of cycles for transport, recreation, exercise or
          sport. People engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists",[4]
          "bicyclists", or "bikers". <br /><br />Apart from two-wheeled
          bicycles, "cycling" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles,
          quadricycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).
          Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number
          approximately one billion worldwide. They are the principal means of
          transportation in many parts of the world, especially in densely
          populated European cities.

          <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of
          flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider
          aircraft with no rigid primary structure.The pilot sits in a harness
          or lies prone in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing.
          Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air
          entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of
          the air flowing over the outside. <br />
          <br />Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many
          hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to
          five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By
          skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height,
          often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
          two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
          or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
          towards the shore.<br /><br />
          Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but
          can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in
          rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
